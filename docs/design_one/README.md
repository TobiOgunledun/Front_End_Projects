A PET WEBSITE 

Participants: Tolu Ayobami(UI/UX,Â  FrontEnd Developer), Oluwatobi Ogunledun(FrontEnd Developer). 

Overview 

So we came up with this beautiful idea to build a Corporate Website for a Pet store particularly for Dogs. Dogs, as we know, are the closest companion to man from the Animal Kingdom. 

We also aim at getting better at what we do as this project will also expose us to other web developers outside.
